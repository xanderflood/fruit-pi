steps to building a system from config:
=======================================

4) the whole pipeline/dag should be cancellable, but remember that the individual units are stateful, and state should be preserved

Have various "output back to the fruit-pi server" units:
1) bool_alert -> Twilio
2) float_alert -> Twilio
3) json_state -> (assembles a single JSON string output composed from many other unit outputs and states, and upserts it with a timestamp to a dynamodb table)
# also, invent an "alert" unit (or several for different types of trigger) that uses a new "alert" endpoint on the fruit-pi-server, maybe to push a text message or something?
